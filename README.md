# Getting Stuck Going to Sheep's Bridge

Recently, my friends and I went on a road trip to **Sheep's Bridge**, which is a popular off-roading spot. The route involved crossing some significant water bodies—the primary natural water sources in Arizona. The water flows from **Lake Powell** in Utah, through **Horseshoe**, down **Rio Verde**, and eventually to **Bartlett Lake**. On our way there, I crossed a water section in my car with water reaching a few feet up the sides and the doors. However, on the way back, I went through a little too quickly and got water up and over my hood—leading to some serious engine trouble.

## The Incident: Engine Seizure
As I tried to pull out of the water, my engine seized. When I attempted to crank it over, it wouldn’t start. My initial thought was that I had **hydro-locked** the engine, which would mean water got into the cylinders. We immediately checked the intake, and to my relief, it was **bone dry**. 

Next, we inspected the cylinders using a shop rag, and they were dry as well. However, during the process of checking **cylinder 4**, one of my friends accidentally **broke a spark plug wire**. While it was a setback, at least it confirmed that my engine wasn’t hydro-locked.

## Discovering the Real Problem: Water in Fuel Lines
Then I remembered something: before the trip, I had burnt a hole in my **evap canister** and removed it. This left an **evap tube** open and facing forward. When I went back through the water at speed, it likely forced water into that tube and into my fuel system.

To confirm this, we disconnected the **fuel lines** closer to the engine and cranked it over, pumping a sample of fuel into a cut-off plastic water bottle. Sure enough, the fuel had **water mixed in**. We continued cranking the engine until the smell of gas replaced that of water. To confirm the sample was pure gas, we filled another bottle, dipped a stick in it, and lit it—it went up in flames, proving it was pure gas. With the fuel lines purged of water, we reconnected them.

## Getting Back on the Trail
With everything back together, the engine turned over and ran, though I was missing **cylinder 4** in my **V6 engine** due to the broken spark plug wire. Despite this, we finished the trail, crossing the water section two more times, and drove home on **4 cylinders**.

Once home, I ordered some **spark plug wires** on Amazon, replaced the broken wire, and the engine was back to running on all 6 cylinders. I also replaced the **evap canister** to avoid any future water intrusion issues. 

## Remaining Issue: Small Evap Leak
There is still a **small evap leak**, likely due to damage from the initial problem. My next step is to **drop the fuel tank** and perform a **smoke test** to find the exact location of the leak so I can fix it properly.

Overall, this experience taught me a lot about diagnosing on-the-fly engine issues, working with fuel systems, and troubleshooting problems in a less-than-ideal environment. Even though it started as a road trip adventure, it ended up being a valuable, hands-on learning experience with vehicle mechanics.
